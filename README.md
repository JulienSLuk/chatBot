Excel VBA Chatbot
Overview
The Excel VBA Chatbot is a powerful tool designed to assist users in performing common tasks within an Excel workbook. It uses a dynamic knowledge base to process user commands and execute corresponding macros or provide helpful responses. This makes it ideal for streamlining repetitive tasks and enhancing productivity.

Features
1. Dynamic Knowledge Base
The chatbot leverages a worksheet (KnowledgeBase) to store commands and their corresponding responses. This allows you to easily add or update commands without modifying the VBA code.

2. Macro Execution
The chatbot can trigger predefined macros to perform specific tasks, such as cleaning data, formatting dates, or appending data across sheets.

3. Custom Responses
For each recognized command, the chatbot provides a tailored response or action. If a command is unrecognized, it suggests checking the knowledge base for available options.

4. Logging User Queries
User interactions are logged in the ChatLog sheet, allowing you to track usage and identify frequently used commands.

Usage Instructions
1. Setting Up the Knowledge Base
The chatbot uses a worksheet called KnowledgeBase with the following structure:

Command	Response
cleanup output	Clears all data except headers in the output sheet.
append data	Appends data from the pd sheet to the output sheet.
find missing nrics	Identifies missing NRICs and lists them in column C.
format dates	Formats dates in the latestNR sheet to the DD/MM/YYYY format.
To add a new command, simply insert a row in the KnowledgeBase sheet:
Command: The keyword or phrase the chatbot should recognize.
Response: A description or explanation of what the command does.
2. Running the Chatbot
Navigate to the Developer Tab → Macros → Select VBAChatBot → Click Run.
Enter your command in the input box when prompted.
The chatbot will either provide a response, execute a task, or suggest checking the knowledge base if the command is unrecognized.
3. Performing Tasks with the Chatbot
Below are some common commands and their outcomes:

Command	Outcome
cleanup output	Clears all data except headers in the output sheet.
append data	Appends data from the pd sheet to the output sheet.
format dates	Reformats dates in specific columns of the latestNR sheet.
find missing nrics	Identifies missing NRICs and outputs them in column C.
Technical Details
Core Components
KnowledgeBase Sheet: Stores chatbot commands and their responses.
ChatLog Sheet: Tracks user queries and responses for reference.
Predefined Macros:
CleanUpOutput: Clears non-header data in the output sheet.
AppendData: Combines data from the pd sheet with the output sheet.
FormatDates: Converts date formats in latestNR to DD/MM/YYYY.
FindMissingNRICs: Identifies and outputs missing NRICs.
Code Flow
User inputs a command into the chatbot.
The chatbot checks the KnowledgeBase sheet for a matching command.
If a match is found, the corresponding macro or response is triggered.
If no match is found, a default message is returned.
Customization
Adding New Commands
To add a new command:

Open the KnowledgeBase sheet.
Add a new row with the command and its description or macro action.
Expanding Functionality
You can extend the chatbot by:

Adding new macros for specific tasks.
Modifying the GetChatbotResponse function to support advanced logic.
Troubleshooting
1. Unrecognized Commands
Ensure the command is spelled correctly.
Verify the command exists in the KnowledgeBase sheet.
2. Macros Not Running
Enable macros in Excel.
Ensure all referenced macros are present in the workbook.
3. Date Format Errors
Confirm date columns have consistent formatting before running FormatDates.
Future Enhancements
Dropdown Command Selection: Replace manual typing with a dropdown for command selection.
Natural Language Processing: Improve user input recognition for more conversational interactions.
Multi-Language Support: Enable responses in multiple languages.
